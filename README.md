## Important Notes

- Unless otherwise noted explicitly, the first **region** listed in the **locations** parameter (array) will represent the **primary** region and the second will denote the **secondary** region.
- The ARM template parameter **name** has to be unique for each Health Bot deployment.  Use an alpha numberic value for this name parameter. All Azure resources deployed by the ARM template will have names prefixed with this deployment name.
- Azure Traffic Manager is used to shift the **Web Chat Client** and **QnA Maker** API traffic across the individual Azure App Service instances deployed in the two regions.  The end user (customer) is responsible for configuring the respective traffic routing algorithm in the Traffic Manager to ensure the traffic is split evenly between the App Service instances as per their requirements.

4. Verify TLS/SSL and Custom domain configurations for App Services

   Login to the Azure Portal.  Go to the *App Service* and click on **Custom domains** and **TLS/SSL settings** blades.  Verify the custom domain, TLS/SSL certificate and bindings have been configured properly.

For configuring custom domains and TLS certificates with the App Services, refer to the articles below.

- [Add an SSL certificate in Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-ssl-certificate)
- [Secure a custom DNS name with SSL binding in Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-ssl-bindings)

## C] Post-deployment Configuration

The following steps have to be completed manually once the ARM template is deployed and all required resources have been provisioned on Azure.

1. Generate the QnA Maker **Knowledge Base** for **COVID-19 FAQs** in the **Health Bot Service** Portal

   Login to *Azure Portal* and retrieve the QnA Maker **Subscription Key** by accessing the *Cognitive Service*.  The Cognitive Service resource should have a name that ends with **-qna**.  See screenshot below.

   ![alt tag](./images/A-01.jpg)

   Login to *Health Bot Service Portal*, access the **Scenario Template Catalog** and create a QnA Model using **COVID-19 FAQs** template. See screenshots below.

   ![alt tag](./images/A-02.jpg)

   Specify the QnA Maker Subscription Key which you retrieved in the previous step.  Then click on **Import template**.

   ![alt tag](./images/A-03.jpg)

   Exit out of the *Scenario Editor*.  The previous step creates the following resources which can be viewed by accessing the respective portals.  See below.

   **Health Bot Service Portal**
   - **Scenario** : COVID-19 FAQs

     ![alt tag](./images/A-04.jpg)

   - **Model** : COVID-19 FAQs

     ![alt tag](./images/A-05.jpg)

   **Azure Portal**
   - **Cognitive Search** : Name ends with **-search0**.  Verify search **indexes** has been created.

     ![alt tag](./images/A-06.jpg)

   **QnA Maker Portal**
   - **Knowledge Base** : Healthcare Bot COVID-19 CDC

     ![alt tag](./images/A-07.jpg)

   Review the above resources.
   
2. Back up the QnA Maker runtime in **primary** region and restore it in the **secondary** region

   The ARM template deploys one **Cognitive Services** resource and two QnA Maker **App Service** instances, one in each region. The template deploys the **QnA Maker** runtime only in the App Service instance deployed in the primary region. As a consequence, the QnA Maker runtime has to be deployed in the secondary region.  The quickest and easiest way is to take a back up of the QnA Maker App Service instance in the primary region and restore it in the secondary region.

   Refer to [Back up an app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/manage-backup) to take a back up of the QnA Maker App Service in the **primary** region. The QnA Maker App Service in the primary region would have a name ending with **-qnahost0**.

   Refer to [Restore a backup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/web-sites-restore) to restore the back up from primary into the secondary region.  The QnA Maker App Service in the secondary region would have a name ending with **-qnahost1**.

3. Reconfigure the QnA Maker runtime in **secondary** region

   Update QnA Maker App Service application settings in **secondary** region.


   In Azure Portal, access the QnA Maker App Service instance in **secondary** region.  The name for this resource should end with **-qnahost1**.  Access the **Configuration** blade of the App Service and update application settings values listed in the table below.

   Parameter Name | Description
   -------------- | -----------
   AzureSearchName | Specify the name of the Cognitive Search resource. Name of this resource should end with **-search1**.
   AzureSearchAdminKey | Specify the value of Cognitive Search Admin key (Primary admin key). You can retrieve this key by accessing the **Keys** blade of the Cognitive Search instance.
   UserAppInsightsAppId | Application Insights App ID
   UserAppInsightsKey | Application Insights Instrumentation Key
   UserAppInsightsName | Application Insights resource name

   >**NOTE:** Remember to specify the names of the resources and application insights keys deployed in the **secondary** region.

   Click **Save** and this will restart the QnA Maker App Service in the **secondary** region.

4. Synchronize the Azure Search **Indexes** in the **primary** and **secondary** regions

   Finally, invoke the *Azure Function* to copy the search **indexes** from the Cognitive Search instance in primary to secondary.

   The Azure Function name ends with **-qnakb-sync** and is deployed in **primary** region.  This Function is configured with both an **HTTP** and **Timer** trigger.

   To initiate the synchronization process manually, issue a HTTP `GET` API call to the Function's HTTP endpoint (below) from a web browser or a terminal window (using `curl` command).

   http://[**name**]-qnakb-sync.azurewebsites.net/api/httpcogsearchkbsync

   Substitute the deployment **name** in the `name` placeholder above.

   >**NOTE:** The source code for the Azure Search [synchronization function](https://github.com/ganrad/AzSearchSyncIndexes) is available on GitHub.  The synchronization code can also be run as a standalone program.  The source code for the [standalone](https://github.com/pchoudhari/QnAMakerBackupRestore) program is also available on GitHub.
